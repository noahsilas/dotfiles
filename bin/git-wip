# A small helper to quickly commit a thought or experiment without
# needing to conform to things like precommit hooks. Makes it easy to
# jam a small commit into place that I will rewrite later.

# Sample usage:
#   git wip Trying out a weird test strategy
MESS="WIP: ${@:1}"
git commit --no-verify --message "${MESS}"
